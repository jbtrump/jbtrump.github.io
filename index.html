								<b>2020-Present:	Research Assistant - Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah</b>
							<p>
								I am currently conducting research at BYU about current practices for teaching introductory astronomy using a 
								planetarium. As part of this research project, I created a survey that will be sent out to every planetarium in 
								an educational instituion around the entire United States.
							<p>
								<b>2018-2019:		Research Assistant - Orson Pratt Observatory, Provo, Utah</b>
							<p>
								I worked for about a year at the Orson Pratt Observatory on BYU campus aquiring and analyzing data on variable stars.
								Variable stars are stars that change in brightness over consistent intervals.
							<p>
								<b>Summer 2017:		Observer and Analyst, West Mountain Obs., Santaquin, Utah</b>
							<p>
								I worked for a summer with other students at the West Mountain Observatory operated by BYU. It was a fun 
								adventure that allowed me to truly experience life as an astronomer (being up all night and alseep during most of 
								the day). I enjoyed the experience and learned a lot about telescope operation, and how to aquire quality data. See me
								next to the big telescope <a href="images/A233poster.jpg" target="_blank"> here.</a>
